#Background

In 2016 I graduated with a degree from Michigan Technological University after years of robotics research, internships, and spending time in outdoors. Since then I've been working as perception engineer and researcher by changing the way that robots see the world.

Since my work is mainly focused around building algorithms for new and exciting sensors, I'll showcase that here.

#Lidar
While in college I developed used a Hokuyo lidar like [this one](https://acroname.com/store/lidar-scanner-r314-hokuyo-laser4?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyZGAsYvr-QIVRjizAB2pqQy3EAQYBiABEgL4LfD_BwE) in order to map bridges is the Metro-Detroit Area like [this one](https://mtri.org/mdot_uav.html) under Dr. Timothy C. Havens.


Continuing that work, I added a camera to the same data collection system in order to develop a novel [camera-lidar](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/dynamicsystems/article-abstract/139/7/071002/395297/Heterogeneous-Multisensor-Fusion-for-Mobile) sensor fusion system for pose estimation.


I continued my mapping work at Argo by [patenting](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11164369B2/en) a method to develop cm-level precision ground height maps for Argo AI using Gaussian Processes.


While still at Argo, I spent a significant amount of my time helping develop firmware and novel algorithms for Argo's custom [Geiger-Mode](https://www.argo.ai/company-news/breakthrough-new-lidar-technology-gives-argo-ai-the-edge-in-autonomous-delivery-and-ride-hail-services/) lidar.

#Stereo
While at Argo, I also pushed the state-of-the-art in stereo depth estimation by developing a [novel approach](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=E0nbCrYAAAAJ&citation_for_view=E0nbCrYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) for deep stereo vision on high-resolution images in real-time.


#Radar
At Waymo, I use our incredible [imaging radar](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2021/11/15/waymos-new-imaging-radar-takes-them-through-san-francisco-fog/?sh=d07c3602937f) to build novel deep radar algorithms for object detection.

#In General
I consider myself to be a robotics engineer with a specialization in building machine learning algorithms for novel sensors. I'm always happy to chat! If you want to learn more about me please use one of the links below, or just checkout my [CV](/ManelaCV.pdf) for more information.
