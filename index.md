In 2016 I graduated with a degree from Michigan Technological University after years of robotics research, internships, and spending time in outdoors. Since then I've been working as perception engineer and researcher by changing the way that robots see the world.

I started by developing novel prediction systems for Uber ATG's self driving car. I then moved over to Argo AI, being one of the original members of the team, where I pushed the state-of-the art in several different sensor modalities. I helped develop novel machine learning algorithms for their patented Geiger-Mode Argo Lidar. I then shifted to stereo depth estimation, where I pushed the limits in real-time deep stereo depth on high resolution images. Now I work at Waymo where I have shifted my attention to evolving the still very young field of camera-radar fusion.

In general, I consider myself to be a robotics engineer with a specialization in building machine learning algorithms for novel sensors. I'm always happy to chat! If you want to learn more about me please use one of the links below, or just checkout my [CV](/ManelaCV.pdf) for more information.
