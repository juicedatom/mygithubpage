I'm an engineer who loves teaching, robotics, and programming! Currently, I work at ArgoAI as an engineer in the perception team but my experience takes me further than just software. I ahve experience working on boat engine hareware, large-scale security systems, robotics, and much more!

If you're interested more about me, you can download my [CV here](/ManelaCV.pdf).
