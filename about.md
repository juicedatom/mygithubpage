In 2016 I graduated with my bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from Michigan Technological University.  During my time in school I researched Simultanious Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and non-convex optimization.

Before graduating I worked at several companies for internships and co-ops doing a variety of work.  Some of my work includes the following:

* Working for a startup developing an electronic medical record system
* Simulating assembly-line robots at Applied Manufacturing Technologies
* Developing boat engine software and hardware at Mercury Marine
* Securing Amazon.com's internal services with custom protocols
* Working at Facebook to build and validate network-switch hardware

After my degree I worked at the Uber Advanced Technology Group (ATG) developing self-driving machine learning algorithms for their self-driving Uber cars.  I spent much of my time writing software and riding around in the cars debugging issues.  Since then I have left Uber and joined Argo AI to help build software perception systems for their self-driving car. I have recently applied to grad school where I would like to continue my interests in developing self-driving car algorithms at an academic level.
